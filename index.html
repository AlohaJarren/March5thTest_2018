      <h3> Git Workflow </h3>
      <p> When working with a group on a certain project placed in Github, one individual creates a repository and shares it with their group. From there, every individual creates their own branches through command ~git checkout -b [branch_name]. Every time someone commits a change, an individual may create a pull request to be approved by the creator of the repository. If the pull request is accepted, the master branch inherits the changes and every individual must update their branch's code to be worked on to avoid potential errors in GitHub.</p>
